            This is Jack.  Today is his birthday he turns 25 years old.  He woke up today with a box sitting on his front step!<br>
            What did Jack get in this mystery box to make him so <em>happy</em>?
            <br>
            <br>
            Jack's mystery box contained:</p>
        <ul class ="text">
            <li>Star Wars Lego</li>
            <li>A CAT!</li>
            <li>Fluffy Socks</li>
            <li>A brand new Bike</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">He knew that whoever left him this package must've been reading his birthday list because he asked for these things from 
            <a href=www.Toysrus.com>www.toysrus.com</a> and <a href=www.toysrus.com>eToys</a> </p>
