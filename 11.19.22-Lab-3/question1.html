            let exp1 = (" " + 1 + 0);   //10 this converts to a string 
            let exp2 = (" " - 1 + 0);   //-1 this will remain a number
            // let exp3 = true = false;   //return error
            let exp4 = (6 / "3");   //2  this converts to a number type
            let exp5 = ("2" * "3");  //6  this converts to a number type
            let exp6 = (4 + 5 + "px");  //9px  the numbers will add and combine as a string with the string
            let exp7 = ("$" + 4 + 5);  //$45  everything will add together as a sting
            let exp8 = ("4" - 2);  //2 will all convert to a number
            let exp9 = ("4px" - 2); //Nan  Converts to string??? cannot remove 2 from a string where the character 2 doesnt exsist???
            let exp10 = (" -9 "  + 5); // -9 5 Converts to string
            let exp11 = (" -9 " - 5); //  -14  Converts to number... not sure difference from above the negative number in a string doesn't seem to have issues combining two negative values
            let exp12 = (null + 1);  // 1  null seems to = 0
            let exp13 = (undefined + 1);  // Nan   undefined doesn't represent anything
            let exp14 = (" \t \n" -2); // -2  \t and \n are meant to give instructions and aren't read as data types? \n means 'new line' not sure about \t
