            // 2 Here's a code that asks the user for two nubmers and shows their sum.  It works uncorrectly.
            //  The output in the example below is 12 (for default prompt values)/
            // Why?  Fix it.  The result should be 3

            //Why... they convert to a string because
            //The prompt function seems to only work with string data types???
            //How to avoid the convertion or convert back

            let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
            let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);


            alert(Number(a) + Number(b));  //3 built in Number() function seems like the simplest why to display the strings as numbers
